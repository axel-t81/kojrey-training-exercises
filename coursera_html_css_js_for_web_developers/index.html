        <h2>Pasta</h2>
        </div> -->
        <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, 
            and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. While Asian noodles originated 
            in China, pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine,
            with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.</p>

            <h2>Rice</h2>
        </div> -->
        <p>Rice is a cereal grain and in its domesticated form is the staple food of over half of the world's population, 
            particularly in Asia and Africa. Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice)â€”or, much less 
            commonly, Oryza glaberrima (African rice). Asian rice was domesticated in China some 13,500 to 8,200 years ago; 
            African rice was domesticated in Africa about 3,000 years ago. Rice has become commonplace in many cultures worldwide.</p>

        </div> -->
        <p>Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is either rolled flat and cut, stretched, or extruded, 
            into long strips or strings. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures and made into a variety of shapes.
            Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They are often pan-fried or 
            deep-fried. Noodles are often served with an accompanying sauce or in a soup.</p>
